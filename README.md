# Bevoids
A **WIP** bevy plugin that aims to make boids easy to add to your game.

## How to use
I recommend to check out [examples](examples), to see how bevoids is used.

### Adding the plugin, and configuring
For the plugin to work, you need to register it.

You also need to add the BoidsConfig resource, where you configure the space (2d or 3d), and enable/disable debugging:

```rust
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, BoidsPlugin))
        .insert_resource(BoidsConfig {
            space: BoidSpace::TwoDimensional,
            debug: false,
        })
        .run();
}
```

### Creating a Boid entity.
To create a boid entity, add the Boid component to your entity:

```rust
commands.spawn((
      MaterialMesh2dBundle {
          mesh: meshes
              .add(shape::RegularPolygon::new(10.0, 3).into())
              .into(),
          material: materials.add(ColorMaterial::from(Color::WHITE)),
          transform: Transform::from_xyz(x as f32 * spacer, y as f32 * spacer, 0.0),
          ..default()
      },
      Boid::new(
          BoidSpeed::new(BOID_MIN_SPEED, BOID_MAX_SPEED),
          BoidTurningStrength::new(
              BOID_COHESION,
              BOID_SEPARATION,
              BOID_ALIGNMENT,
              BOID_BORDER_TURN_STRENGTH,
          ),
          BoidViewConfig::new(BOID_FOV, BOID_PROTECTED_RANGE, BOID_VIEW_RANGE),
      )
  ));
}
```

### Limiting the Boid's area of movement
If you want the boid to only move within a restricted area, add the BoidBorder component to it.

#### The component works like this:
It has 6 parameters; left, right, top, etc... Each of these parameters is an `Option<(f32, f32)>`, 
where the first `f32` represents the position of the border, and the second represents a margin for when the boid should start turning.

Each side is optional, to give you the choice of where to restrict.
You can for example only restrict the top and bottom, for birds that can roam the entire world!

```rust
commands.spawn((
        MaterialMesh2dBundle {
            mesh: meshes
                .add(shape::RegularPolygon::new(10.0, 3).into())
                .into(),
            material: materials.add(ColorMaterial::from(Color::WHITE)),
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(x as f32 * spacer, y as f32 * spacer, 0.0),
            ..default()
        },
        Boid::new(
            BoidSpeed::new(BOID_MIN_SPEED, BOID_MAX_SPEED),
            BoidTurningStrength::new(
                BOID_COHESION,
                BOID_SEPARATION,
                BOID_ALIGNMENT,
                BOID_BORDER_TURN_STRENGTH,
            ),
            BoidViewConfig::new(BOID_FOV, BOID_PROTECTED_RANGE, BOID_VIEW_RANGE),
        ),
        BoidBorder {
            left: Some((-BORDER_WIDTH / 2.0, BORDER_MARGIN)),
            right: Some((BORDER_WIDTH / 2.0, BORDER_MARGIN)),
            top: Some((BORDER_HEIGHT / 2.0, BORDER_MARGIN)),
            bottom: Some((-BORDER_HEIGHT / 2.0, BORDER_MARGIN)),
            front: None,
            back: None,
        },
    ));
}
```

## Examples

| Example name | Scene                             |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| simple2d     | A simple 2d scene with 400 boids  |
| simple3d     | A simple 3d scene with 1000 boids |

To run example, run `cargo run --example <example-name>`
